## Welcome to Azure Mission-Critical

Azure Mission-Critical is an open source project that provides a **prescriptive architectural approach to building highly-reliable cloud-native applications on Microsoft Azure for mission-critical workloads**. More specifically, this repository contains everything required to understand and implement an "always on" application on Microsoft Azure, and is comprised of the following:

1. **Architectural Guidelines**: cloud-native design methodology to guide readers through the architectural process of building a mature mission-critical application on Microsoft Azure, articulating key design considerations and requisite design decisions along with associated trade-offs.

2. **Fully Functional Reference Implementations**: end-to-end reference implementations intended to provide a solution orientated basis to showcase mission-critical application development on Microsoft Azure, leveraging Azure-native platform capabilities to maximize reliability and operational effectiveness.
    - Design and implementation guidance to help readers understand and use the Azure Mission-Critical design methodology in the context of a particular scenario.
    - Production-ready technical artifacts including Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) resources and Continuous-Integration/Continuous-Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines (GitHub and Azure DevOps) to deploy an Azure Mission-Critical application with mature end-to-end operational wrappers.

## Azure Mission-Critical | Navigation

- [Introduction | What is Mission-Critical?](./docs/introduction/README.md) - Detailed introduction into Mission-Critical, the problem it is intended to solve and the value it can provide.

- [Design Methodology | Mission-Critical Architectural Approach](./docs/design-methodology/README.md) - Prescriptive guidance aligned to 8 critical design areas guides users to design and build an mission-critical application, outlining a recommended decision process.

- [Reference Implementation | Online](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Online) - Everything required to understand and build a copy of the reference implementation intended for online scenarios that are public-facing and do not require private network connectivity to a surrounding organizational technical estate.

- [Reference Implementation | Connected](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Connected) - Everything required to understand and build a copy of the reference implementation intended for private scenarios that require integration with an organizational technical estate for either public-facing or internal-facing workloads.

## Helpful Information

The reference implementations are separated within dedicated repositories containing all relevant documentation and technical artifacts, along with a *getting started guide*:
