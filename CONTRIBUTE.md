# How to Contribute to Azure Mission-Critical

## Content Changes and Pull Requests

To add or edit content within the Azure Mission-Critical repositories, please take a fork of a repository to iterate on changes before subsequently opening a Pull Request (PR) to get your forked branch merged into the main branch for the Azure Mission-Critical repository. Your PR will be reviewed by core engineers working on the project, and once approved, your content accessible to everybody.

> **Important!** Please make sure that your PR is focused on a specific area of Azure Mission-Critical to facilitate a targeted review, as this will speed up the process to get your changes merged into our repository.

## Content Structure

[![Mission-critical repo structure](/docs/media/repo-structure.png "Mission-critical repo structure")](./CONTRIBUTE.md)

The Azure Mission-Critical project is separated into **3** different repositories:

- [Mission-Critical](/docs/README.md): contains the Azure Mission-Critical design methodology, covering the design pattern ad approach to guide readers to defining a target Mission-Critical architecture.
  - Overarching topics are documented as separate markdown documents within the `/docs/` directory.

- [Mission-Critical Online](http://github.com/azure/Mission-Critical-Online): contains the mission-critical reference implementation intended for online scenarios that are public-facing and do not require private network connectivity to a surrounding organizational technical estate.
  - [`/docs/`](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Online/tree/main/docs) contains the majority of documentation, covering the design approach and detailed documentation to accompany the reference implementation.
  - [`/src/`](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Online/tree/main/src) contains all source code and technical artifacts for the reference implementation along with low level implementation documentation.
  - [`/.ado/pipelines`](https://github.com/Azure/Mission-Critical-Online/tree/main/.ado/pipelines) contains the Azure DevOps pipelines to build and deploy the reference implementation.

- [Mission-Critical Connected](http://github.com/azure/alwayson-foundational-connected): contains the  mission-critical reference implementation intended for private scenarios that require integration with an organizational technical estate for either public-facing or internal-facing workloads.
  - [`/docs/`](http://github.com/azure/alwayson-foundational-connected/tree/main/docs) contains the majority of documentation, covering the design approach and detailed documentation to accompany the reference implementation.
  - [`/src/`](http://github.com/azure/alwayson-foundational-connected/tree/main/src) contains all source code and technical artifacts for the reference implementation along with low level implementation documentation.
  - [`/.ado/pipelines`](http://github.com/azure/alwayson-foundational-connected/tree/main/.ado/pipelines) contains the Azure DevOps pipelines to build and deploy the reference implementation.

## Documentation Conventions

Each source code component within the reference implementation repositories has it's own `README.md` file which explains how that particular component works, how it is supposed to be used, and how it may interact with other aspects of the mission-critical solution.

Within the `main` branch, each `README.md` file must accurately represent the state of the associated component which will serve as a core aspect of PR reviews. Any modifications to source components must therefore be reflected in the documentation as well.
